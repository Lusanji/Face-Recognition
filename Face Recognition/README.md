# Face-Recognition-Using-OpenCV
Face detection and recognition is technology which is used to identify a person from a image or video.

# OpenCV
OpenCV is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. It contains more than 2500 optimized algorithms of computer vision and machine learning. It has Python, C++, Java and MATLAB programming interfaces and supports Windows, Linux, Android and Mac OS. This library comes with FaceRecognizer class which can be used for face recognition.

# Face Detection
For Face Detection, Haar cascade classifier is used. A classifier is an algorithm that decides whether a given image is positive (face) or negative (not a face). Haar cascade classifier provided by OpenCV is pre-trained classifier, trained on thousands of images with or without faces. This classifier has high detection accuracy and features used by detector are computer very quickly.

# Face Recognition
LBPH(Local Binary Pattern Histogram) is one of the popular face recognition algorithms. It is a feature based approach meaning it processes input image to identify and extract distinctive features. It is possible to get good results with this recognizer but in a controlled environment. This algorithm take use of LBP(Local Binary Pattern) and HOG(Histograms of Oriented Gradients) for improving the detection performance on some datasets.
